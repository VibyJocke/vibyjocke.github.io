# About me

I'm a senior software engineer operating from Stockholm. I believe in looking further than the code, focusing on delivered value in any shape. It's important to know your tools, but equally important to not get stuck staring into the toolbox, forgetting to use the tools for what they were made for - solving actual problems.
